# Machine Learning

I created this section to illustrate some applications of Machine Learning using Python as programming language.

They are divided in the following sections:

Supervised Learning:
- Regression Algorithms
- Classifications Algorithms

Unsupervised Learning:
 - Clustering Algorithms
 - Dimensionality Reduction
